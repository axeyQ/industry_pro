// src/middleware.js

// Middleware no longer required as authorization is removed.
// You can either delete this file or leave it empty.

// Optionally, if you have other middleware logic, retain it here.

// Example: Empty middleware
export function middleware(req) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
  
  export const config = {};
